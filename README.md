# Diffusion-MRI
Scripts for analyzing diffusion MRI data in order to calculate DTI, DKI and NODDI parametric maps.
Pre-processing includes diffusion MRI data denoising, susceptibility-induced distortion correction using FSL TOPUP and eddy current-induced
distortion and motion correction using FSL EDDY.
